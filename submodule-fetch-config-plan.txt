About reading and applying configuration of non-checked out revisions during fetch
==================================================================================

1. During collection phase:
   For each revision that changes a submodule store:
	* commit sha1 (for subsequent readings of the same config)
	* path
	* name

2. During fetch phase:
   For each index entry that is a gitlink:
   	* lookup module name from checked out config and local
	* check if that module name is in the collection
	* do as said in checked out config and local
	* remove module from collection

3. Next step implementation for during fetch:
   For each leftover submodule in collection:
   	* lookup config from collection
		** if all fetch configuration are the same:
			*** read configuration from revisions
		** read local configuration superseeding revisions config
		** if it does not exist in .git/modules
			*** clone into ./git/modules if configured so
		** else
			*** fetch if configured so
	* remove module from collection
